# Salesforce DX Project: Next Steps

Now that you’ve created a Salesforce DX project, what’s next? Here are some documentation resources to get you started.

## How Do You Plan to Deploy Your Changes?

Do you want to deploy a set of changes, or create a self-contained application? Choose a [development model](https://developer.salesforce.com/tools/vscode/en/user-guide/development-models).

## Configure Your Salesforce DX Project

The Recipe & Meal Planning Manager is designed to simplify meal organization for individuals. Users can:

-Add and categorize recipes with ingredients, instructions, and preparation time
-Plan weekly meals and assign recipes to specific days
-Automatically generate a shopping list for all planned meals
-Track trends such as most-used recipes and popular ingredients
This project demonstrates practical usage of CRM-style management, inventory tracking, process automation, and dashboard reporting in a personal lifestyle application.
